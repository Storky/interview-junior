# Closures and Decorators

Closure - is a function, which has access to the scope of other function, even if called in another scope.

### Decorator

Decorator - take a function as an argument and return a new function that enhances the function argument without modifying it.

```javascript
const logger = (message) => console.log(message)

function loggerDecorator (logger) {
    return function (message) {
        logger.call(this, message)
        console.log("message logged at:", new Date().toLocaleString())
    }
}

const decoratedLogger = loggerDecorator(logger);
```


### Higher-Order Functions

A function that accepts and/or returns another function is called a higher-order function.

It’s higher-order because instead of strings, numbers, or booleans, it goes higher to operate on functions. Pretty meta.

With functions in JavaScript, you can

- Store them as variables
- Use them in arrays
- Assign them as object properties (methods)
- Pass them as arguments
- Return them from other functions

Like any other piece of data. That’s the key here.
