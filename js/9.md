# OOP and Func approaches

## OOP
- using objects to model data and functions
- can be folded inside another objects

4 main OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism

#### Abstraction
Creating a simple model of a more complex thing. This model "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information. 

#### Inheritance
Subclass may inherit data from parent class.

#### Polymorphism
Ability to implement same functionality in multiple objects.

#### Encapsulation
Bundling data and its methods into a single unit.


## FP

Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.


- Pure functions
- Function composition
- Avoid shared state
- Avoid mutating state
- Avoid side effects

#### Pure function
- Given the same inputs, always returns the same output, and
- Has no side-effects

#### Function composition
The process of combining two or more functions in order to produce a new function
```javascript
f(g(x))
```

#### Shared State
Shared state is any variable, object, or memory space that exists in a shared scope, or as the property of an object being passed between scopes. A shared scope can include global scope or closure scopes. Often, in object oriented programming, objects are shared between scopes by adding properties to other objects.
