# WebPack

## 1. What is webpack
**Webpack** is a build tool that puts all of your assets, including Javascript, images, fonts, and CSS, in a dependency graph. Webpack lets you use require() in your source code to point to local files, like images, and decide how they're processed in your final Javascript bundle, like replacing the path with a URL pointing to a CDN.

## 2. What is Bundle

**Bundle** is the output file generated by webpack. It contains all of the modules which are used in application. Bundles generation process is regulated by webpack config file. 
## 3. HMR - hot module replacement
## 4. Loaders
- are transformations that are applied on the source code of a module. Webpack supports modules written in a variety of languages and preprocessors, via loaders. 
## 5. Difference to Gulp
Webpack is bundler, Gulp is task runner. But Webpack evolved to run vast majority of tasks as well.
But its rather difficult to configure.


## 6. Adding scripts

In webpack.config.js u can use javascript, functions, install plugins, use variables passed via scripts in package.json

```javascript
const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

  "scripts": {
    "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack --mode development",
    "build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack --mode production",
    "watch": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack --mode development --watch",
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack serve"
  }
```
